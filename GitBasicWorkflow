Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:
1. Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
2. Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory
3. Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository.

Basic Git commands
•	git init
  - creates a new Git repository
•	git status
  - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
•	git add <filename>
  - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
•	git diff
  - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
•	git commit -m "<commit message>"
  - permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
•	git log
  - shows a list of all previous commits
